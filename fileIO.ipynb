    "We first need to 'open' the file and this returns an Python 'object' that we can iterate (or loop) through in a similar way to a list. The `open` function takes 2 parameters - the first, pretty obviously is a file name (don't forget the file extension if it has one). The second is a parameter that indicates what 'mode' we want to open the file in. We use \"r\" if we just want to read from it, \"w\" if we only want to create/write to it (overwriting anything that might be in it if it exists), \"r+\" to both read and write, and \"a\" if we want to append stuff to the end of it. If you don't include a mode, \"r\" is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the techies amongst you, by default, the file is opened in 'text' mode. If you add a 'b' to the mode letter it is opened in binary mode - which can be useful if, for example, you need to look at the individual bytes of data making up a JPEG or EXE file.  The line ends are indicated with special characters - `\\n` (Unix/Linux and Mac) or `\\r\\n` (Windows) depending on what platform we are using. This isn't particularly important for text files but can be a real problem with binary files.\n",
