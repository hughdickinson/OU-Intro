    "# Regular Expressions - regex\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the use of  **_regular expressions_**, which are a powerful syntax for describing and working with character strings in _Python_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest use for regular expressions is to check whether a string of characters contains a particular sub-string. For example, `'Hello World'` contains the sub-string `'llo'` but not `'Earth'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, regular expressions are much more powerful than this simple example. They allow strings to be checked for one or more sub-strings matching some a specific pattern. For example you could define a single regular expression that would match a string containing anywhere between one and three capital letters followed by exactly 5 numbers. Even this example only scratches the surface of the patterns that can be descrived using regular expressions. As first glance the regular expression syntax can seem impenetrably complex but don't worry, we'll go through things step-by-step and introduce some of their useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a common implementation feature of many different programming languages of which _Python_ is only one. Learning the basics will almost certainly pay dividends even if you end up leaving _Python_ behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Python_ implements the regular expressions via the `re` module. There are 3 main functions that you need to know about - **`re.search()`**, **`re.match()`**, and **`re.compile()`**. Actually, **`re.match()`** and **`re.search()`** are only subtly different. The **`re.match()`** function is more conservative will only succeed if the regular expression pattern matches the beginning of a line and won't consider multiple lines separated by a `'\\n'` character. For this reason we'll concentrate on **`re.search()`**, which will succeed if the regular expression pattern matches **anywhere** in a string, even if that string contains multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **`re.search()`** and **`re.match()`** require a \"_template_\" search pattern to be specified using a string containing regular expression syntax. In our `'Hello World'` example above this template would simply be the string of characters we are searching for **`'llo'`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by importing the `re` module."

    "\n",
    "Hopefully, everything so far has seemed very straightforward. Now let's use some of the features of regular expressions to search for character sequences that match a more generic _pattern_ rather than a fixed string of characters. This is where regular expressions become _slightly_ more complicated, but **much** more powerful!\n",
    "\n",

    "The range syntax can be used to matches anything inside it but there are some shortcuts. For example, **`\"r\\d\"`** is equivalent to `\"[0-9]\"` and matches any digit, while **`\\w`** matches any alphanumeric character i.e. **`r\"[0-9a-zA-Z]\"`**, as well as underscores `_`. The full stop **`.'`** matches any single character except the newline character, and **`\\s`** will match any **single** whitespace character including space (` `), newline (`\\n`), tab (`\\t`) and carriage return (`\\r`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Earlier in this notebook, we noted that pattern strings supplied to **`re.search()`** and **`re.match()`** should be coverted into _raw_ strings by prefixing them with `r`. Raw _Python_ strings are used to prevent the _Python_ interpreter from interpreting and replacing or removing any `\\` characters or special characters in the pattern string that are actually part of the regular expression syntax. Depending on the context, it can be difficult to predict exactly how _Python_ will handle special characters that it finds within ordinary strings. For this reason, when defining regular expressions always use _raw_ strings. As a concrete example you should not use **`'\\d\\d'`** to define a pattern that would match two digits in successsion. Instead, always use **`r'\\d\\d'`**.\n"

    "### 2.2 Matching multiple characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibly matching individual letters or numbers isn't particularly useful. In this section, we'll examine how to write regular expressions that match _sequences_ containing multiple characters. For example, you might want to match a string that conatins a _specific number_ of digits in a cluster - strings like `'1224'`, `'892301'` or even `'1'`. To write a regular expression that matches a specific number of characters in a row, we start with an expression that would match a single character (like `'\\d'`) and add a suppix to specify the character count. The suffix consists of the required number enclosed in brace (`{}`) characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, to match 3 digits we would use **`'[0-9]{3}'`** (or **`'\\d{3}'`**). These expressions will not match `3` or `95`, but they _will_ match `735`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Be warned though! Both of these expressions will (when used with **`re.search()`** match any string that includes a sequence of three digits as a substring. This means that `7351` will also match because any 4 digit string also contains a of 3 digit substring! It is 3 digits and we'll see this later. \n",
