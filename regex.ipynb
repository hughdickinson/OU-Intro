    "# Regular Expressions - regex\n",

    "We'll look at regula expressions here. In their simplest form these are a way to check whether a sring of charactars contains a particular sub-string. So, for exaple, 'Hello World' contains the sub-string 'llo' but not 'Earth'. However, they are much more powerful that this and allow strings to be checked for multiple occiurances or for sub-strings matching some form of matching pattern, dor example one, two or three capital letters followed by exactly 5 numbers, or even more comlex matches. As first glance they seem impenetrably complex but we'll go through things step-by-step and introduce some of their useful features.\n",

So we'll tend to concentrate on **`re-serach`**.\n",

To make sure this does not happen, we tack an 'r' onto the front of the pattern string (it stands for 'raw' text please). So dont use, for example**`'\\d\\d'`** use **`r'\\d\\d'`**.\n"
